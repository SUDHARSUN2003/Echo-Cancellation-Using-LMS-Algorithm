# Echo Cancellation using LMS, MLMS, VLMS in Matlab
 Echo Cancellation using LMS, MLMS, VLMS in Matlab
                   This project focuses on the problem of echo interference in speech signals and explores solutions such as half-duplex communication and echo cancellation.
                   The goal is to improve audio teleconferencing by addressing the issue of unwanted echoes in speech transmission.
